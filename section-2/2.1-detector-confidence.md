# Detector Confidence

##### Uses of detector confidence:
* Give strong intervention (conf > ~.6)
* Give no intervention (conf < ~.4)
* Give 'fail-soft' intervention if confidence is between .4 and .6.A

##### Discovery with models analyses:
* When you use this model in further analyses
* __Big Idea:__ Keep all of your information around to make the most informed decision.

##### Types of confience:
* Some models provide none or a "pseudoconfidence" 
* Some give you a straightforward answer.
* Others require you to parse it out of software output.
* Confidence can be "lumpy", meaning that the confidence is "lumped" throughout different parts of the algorithm (e.g.tree and rule based classifiers).
* 

##### Risk Ratio:
* A good way of analyzing the impact of specific predictors
* Used with binary predictors: rr = (probability that a is 0)/(probability that a is 1)
* You can turn a numerical predictors into a binary predictors with a threshold.
* Provides a clear way to communicate the effects of a variable on your predicted outcome.
