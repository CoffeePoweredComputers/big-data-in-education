# Validity

##### Types of Validity:
* Generalizability -> Does you model remain predictive when used in a new data set?
* Ecological Validity -> Does your model remain predictive when used in real world settings? 
* Construct Validity -> Does your model actually measure what it was intended to measure? This question is generally answered by how much you can trust your training data.
* Predictive Validity -> Does your model predict not just the present, but the future as well?
* Substantive Validity -> Doe your results matter? Are you modeling a construct that maters?
* Content Validity -> From testing, does the test cover the full domain it is meant to cover?
* Conclusive Validity -> Are your conclusions validated by your findings?
