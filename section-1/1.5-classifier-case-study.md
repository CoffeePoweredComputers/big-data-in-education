# Case Study - San Pedro

##### Research Goals:
* Can we predict student college attendance based on student learning and engagement in middle school mathematics
* Used fine-grained indicators distilled form interactions with educational software in middle school (~5 years earlier).

##### Why?
* We can infer engagement and learning in middle school, which supports:
  * Automated intervention
  * Providing actionable infer for teachers and admins.

##### Automated Detectors:
* A number of automated detectors were applied to the data for ASSISTments.
* Building a detector and then using it in another analysis is called *discovery with models*.
  * Learning -> Traced with Bayesian Knowledge Tracing
  * Disengagement Detectors:
    * Gaming the system: Systematic guessing, Rapid Hint Requests
    * Off-Task Behavior: Stopping work to do unrelated tasks
    * Carelessness: Making errors despite knowing the skill
  * Affect Detectors:
    * Boredom
    * Frustration
    * Confusion
    * Engaged Concentration

##### College Attendance Model
* Predict whether a student attended college from a student's year-long average according to the detectors.
* Logistic Regression Classifier (did/didn't go to college).
* Cross-validated at the student level. Built on some, tested on others.
