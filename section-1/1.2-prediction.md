# Predication

##### Regression in predication:
* __Label__ -> The thing you want to predict.
* __Regressor__ -> The independent variable in a regression equation.
* __Regressand__ -> The dependent variable in a regression equation.
* __Regression__ -> The process of prediction. The basic idea of regression is to determine which features, in which combination, can predict the label's value.
* __Predictor__ -> The variable that you use to predict the label.

##### Linear Regression:
* Can fit a surprising number of function if you apply transformations.
  * You make a new variable by applying some function to the previous variable.
  * __Unitization__ -> Increases interpretability of relative strength of features. Reduces interpretability of individual features. Xt = (X - M(X))/SD(X)
* It's often more accurate than more complex models, particularly once you cross-validate.

##### Regression Trees:
* __RepTree__ -> Non linear regression tree.
* __M5'__ -> Linear; This allows you to say that there are different linear relationships between some variables depending on other variables.
