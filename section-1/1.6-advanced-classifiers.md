# Advanced Classifiers

##### Support Vector Machines:
* Performs dimensionality reductions on data space and then fits hyperplane which splits classes.
* Good for:
  * Natural Language Processing ->  Text is very high dimensional so it helps to be able to reduce the dimensionality.
  * Sensor Data ->  Helpful given the number of potential inputs present in sensor data.

##### Random Forest:
* Split the training data into random subsets of data points.
* For each subset, take a random set of the data features.
* Build a decision tree on the resultant data set.
* Take all trees, each tree gets one vote and the majority wins.
* Random forests is often used for ensemble models where you want to take a number of models and put them together so you're having a collection of votes on a collection of votes.

##### Recurrent Neural Networks (Deep Learning):
* Try to fit sequences of data rather than single data points.
* Neural Network with partial propagation of information over time
* Several variants depending on how information propagates (e.g. LSTM).
* Commonly used to represent language over time, with sentences and paragraphs represented as sequences of words.
* Used in deep knowledge tracking, representing 
* Used in detectors of student emotion using trends and patterns in emotion over time.
* Used in models prediction MOOC dropout, which has a strong temporal character.
* Used to predict humans' selections of dialogue moves in tutorial dialogue.
