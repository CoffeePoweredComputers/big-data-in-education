# Introduction

##### What makes data big:
* Volume - how much data is there
* Velocity - how fast is data coming in
* Variety - Incompatible formats, non-aligned data structures, inconsistent data semantics

##### Types of educational data mining:
* Prediction - Develop a model which can infer a single aspect of the data from some combination of other aspects of the data. 
* Structure Discovery - Find structure and patterns in the data emerge naturally
* Relationship Mining - Discover relationships between variables in a data set with many variables.
* Discovery with Models - Pre-existing model applied at data and used as a component in another analysis.
