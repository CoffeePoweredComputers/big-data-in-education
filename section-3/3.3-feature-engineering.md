# Feature Engineering

* The art of creating predictor variables.
* How can we take the voluminous, ill-formed, and yet under-specified data that we now have in education and shape it into a reasonable set of variables in an efficient, effective, and predictive way?
  * Brainstorm
  * Decide what features to create
  * Creating the features
  * Study impact
  * Iterate on features if useful
  * Cycle back to 3 or 1

#####  Creating Features:
* Excel - Really good for prototyping
  * Pivot Tables - Great for aggregating data, and getting descriptive statistics.
  * VLookUp - Great for translating from aggregations back to action level data.
  * Counts-so-far
  * Counts-last-n-actions
  * cut-off abased features
* Distillation Code - The scalable solution but harder to check yourself or explore.
