# Behavior Detectors

##### Behavior Detectors
* Automated models that can infer from interaction/logs whether a student is behaving in a certain way.
* Infer meaningful behaviors from logs or in real time towards:
  * Study them more deeply
  * Detect and intervene

##### Behavior Types:
* Disengaged Behaviors:
  * Gaming the System
  * Off-Task Behavior
  * Carelessness
  * Wasn't Thinking Fastidiously (WTF) Behaviors
* Meta-Cognitive Behaviors:
  * Help Avoidance
  * Unscaffolded Self-Explanations
  * Exploration Behaviors
*  Teacher Strategic Behaviors
  * Curriculum Planning Behaviors
  * Teacher Interventions for Students

##### Related Problems:
* Sensor-Free Affect Detection -> Not relying on external sensors to determine affect
* LMS/MOOC Usage Analysis -> Researchers in this area have looked to predict outcomes from relatively straightforward behaviors due to the lack of rich log files.


##### Ground Truth:
* Behaviors labels are noisy, hence the name 
* Sources of ground truth for behaviors:
  * Self-report
  * Field observations
  * Hand-coding of logs
  * Video coding
